                "Hey - I hope it goes well for you üòÅ I'm a pharmacy tech on the West Coast and here are a few things to keep in mind:\nthere is a shortage of ozempic mounjaro saxenda - consistent supply may be a problem and require you bouncing between pharmacies to get it monthly\nsome insurances cover this for weight loss but most don't without a PA (prior authorization) from the doctor's office or a diagnosis of diabetes.\nit's hella expensive - I've had people lose their minds about how much it costs with insurance coverage! There are coupons available (definitely take the time to find them on the ozempic website) that will help with the copay with commercial insurance; coupons will not work with Medicare/Medicaid Tricare and state funded insurance.\nplease look up what a coverage gap AKA donut hole\nplease respect the pharmacy staff lol\nI say all this not to dissuade you! Just some info to keep in mind oftentimes these get overlooked by prescribers and leads to so many problems. I wish you all the best.",

                "There‚Äôs a lot of buzz recently about Ozempic which is one of many semaglutide injection drugs that help people moderate their food intake and hunger levels. Some variations are meant just to treat type 2 diabetes like Ozempic. Other drugs like WeGovy are meant to treat obesity as well.\nWhat I take issue with is that a lot of commenters have stated that they see Ozempic as a ‚Äúlose weight quick drug‚Äù and a cheat. I think this is simply the wrong way to look at the issue. Obesity is a medical issue that can be treated in many ways. For some people seeing a nutritionist and going to the gym is all that is needed but for many more this simply doesn‚Äôt work. I would argue that actually most Americans know generally what a good diet looks like. They may not have all the details but most people can tell you that more vegetables and less meat carbs and sugar will create a calorie deficit and help you lose weight. However food simply tastes really good any many people rely on it as a sort of emotional crutch. Many also lack the time energy and desire to cook healthy food for themselves. There are many who also simply have a naturally large appetite and need to eat more in order to feel full.\nWhat those people need is not a reminder to try ‚Äúdiet and exercise‚Äù they need medical help. Semaglutide injections seem to have low risk of serious side effects and can help those people eat less and not feel hungry. All this moralizing about who ‚Äúdeserves‚Äù help and who should just suck it up and go to the gym is proving to be detrimental to overall health.\nAlso I‚Äôm aware that there is currently a shortage of Semaglutide injections right now but lets set that aside and assume that can be addressed with a more robust supply chain.",

Is it sold in other kind of stores? Usually how much does it cost? Also I'm an expat and have a medical prescription from my doctor back at home. Could I use this prescription to buy my metformin here in the Netherlands or would I need to go to a GP to get a new one? And if I need to go to a GP would they continue with my doctor's diagnosis and treatment or would they need to reconfirm my situation/do tests? If so how much should I expect to pay for blood tests GP appointments etc? How would that work with the health insurance? Should I tell the insurance my situation to see if they cover it or not? Is metformin something they normally cover? I know they're a lot of questions but I'm really lost about this and any guidance would be of great help.",

I honestly think it‚Äôs a good drug for this but insurance rarely covers it just for obesity.

Well 3 months passed and my A1C went from 7.3 to 7.2 not too bad he said but I told him I had a really bad time remembering to take the metformin with every meal and probably only took like 60% of my prescription. I asked again about Ozempic and stated I would look into compounding pharmacy‚Äôs to pay out of pocket I just wanted to see if he would be ok with prescribing it and looking over my treatment with it as I really wanted to lower my A1C to a non diabetic number and wanted ti work on my weight loss. To my surprise he said we could try it and that he actually had samples for me to start. I was thinking it was going to be a single dose but he opened his fridge and gave me a 3 month supply. He said he forgets he has them and has a bunch. Excited to start this journey. Now to save up for the 3 months after this.",

I did my best to translate but after watching a couple of YouTube videos this morning I see I missed a few fine points but it seems I injected successfully. My learning is to watch the videos and go to the official Ozempic website for clear directions.\nWhen I went to the pharmacy I bought their only box left so I will need to plan ahead for my next purchase given the demand.

Apparently there was a nationwide cyberattack & pharmacies have been unable to process the discount resulting in ridiculous prices for the medication. If you're having issues you can give Nordisk (Ozempic manufacturer) a call at 1-800-727-6500. They can provide you with new BIN & PCN numbers to give to the pharmacist so they can process your discount. When you call have your discount card handy as they'll ask you for your group number. Also get comfy when you call because you'll likely be on hold for awhile. Hope this helps someone. I know there are folks who can't afford this medication without that discount! ‚òπ",
