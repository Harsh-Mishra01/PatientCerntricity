There are coupons available (definitely take the time to find them on the ozempic website) that will help with the copay with commercial insurance; coupons will not work with Medicare/Medicaid Tricare and state funded insurance.\nplease look up what a coverage gap AKA donut hole\nplease respect the pharmacy staff lol\nI say all this not to dissuade you!

        "There‚Äôs a lot of buzz recently about Ozempic which is one of many semaglutide injection drugs that help people moderate their food intake and hunger levels. Some variations are meant just to treat type 2 diabetes like Ozempic. Other drugs like WeGovy are meant to treat obesity as well.\nWhat I take issue with is that a lot of commenters have stated that they see Ozempic as a ‚Äúlose weight quick drug‚Äù and a cheat. I think this is simply the wrong way to look at the issue. Obesity is a medical issue that can be treated in many ways. For some people seeing a nutritionist and going to the gym is all that is needed but for many more this simply doesn‚Äôt work. I would argue that actually most Americans know generally what a good diet looks like. They may not have all the details but most people can tell you that more vegetables and less meat carbs and sugar will create a calorie deficit and help you lose weight. However food simply tastes really good any many people rely on it as a sort of emotional crutch. Many also lack the time energy and desire to cook healthy food for themselves. There are many who also simply have a naturally large appetite and need to eat more in order to feel full.\nWhat those people need is not a reminder to try ‚Äúdiet and exercise‚Äù they need medical help. Semaglutide injections seem to have low risk of serious side effects and can help those people eat less and not feel hungry. All this moralizing about who ‚Äúdeserves‚Äù help and who should just suck it up and go to the gym is proving to be detrimental to overall health.\nAlso I‚Äôm aware that there is currently a shortage of Semaglutide injections right now but lets set that aside and assume that can be addressed with a more robust supply chain.",

Well 3 months passed and my A1C went from 7.3 to 7.2 not too bad he said but I told him I had a really bad time remembering to take the metformin with every meal and probably only took like 60% of my prescription.

To my surprise he said we could try it and that he actually had samples for me to start. I was thinking it was going to be a single dose but he opened his fridge and gave me a 3 month supply.

Normally I‚Äôd give a medication more time to work (I‚Äôve been on it almost 6 weeks) but most of what I‚Äôve read is people losing the most weight within the first month or even the first 2 weeks. If you‚Äôve tried Victoza please share how it worked/didn‚Äôt work for you. I‚Äôd love to know how long you took it your dose timeline and when and how much weight you lost. Also open to tips if any come to mind.\nI‚Äôm a 25 year old non-diabetic female at 5‚Äô4 and 280lbs. I lost about 200lbs naturally with diet and exercise and got down to 190lbs for the first time since I was a child. I hit a plateau and then the pandemic depression and emotional distress in moving back home brought me back up to 280lbs within one year. I decided to try a weight loss med to just get a little motivation back. Only Victoza was covered by insurance and able to be found.\nI‚Äôve been on it for about 6 weeks now. I took 0.6 dose for 4 weeks and only lost 2lbs. I‚Äôve now been on 1.2 dose for almost 2 weeks and while I haven‚Äôt weighed myself I notice very little difference. Meanwhile I‚Äôm eating healthily and much less in portion and have stopped emotionally eating entirely. I still work out but not as much ‚Äî due to the side effects hitting me hard. Constant fluttery stomach and migraine heavy nausea lightheadedness and increasingly excessive fatigue. It‚Äôs been tolerable so far especially because it‚Äôs taken my appetite away and I‚Äôve eaten so much less.\nSo to have lost nearly no weight is very disheartening. My insurance denied my request for Wegovy coverage which I‚Äôm debating on appealing. I really hoped Victoza would be effective. Has anyone had a similar experience with not losing much weight? Did it ever start working better? What‚Äôs your Victoza story? Thanks!",

There are coupons available (definitely take the time to find them on the ozempic website) that will help with the copay with commercial insurance; coupons will not work with Medicare/Medicaid Tricare and state funded insurance.\nplease look up what a coverage gap AKA donut hole\nplease respect the pharmacy staff lol\nI say all this not to dissuade you! Just some info to keep in mind oftentimes these get overlooked by prescribers and leads to so many problems. I wish you all the best.",

            "There‚Äôs a lot of buzz recently about Ozempic which is one of many semaglutide injection drugs that help people moderate their food intake and hunger levels. Some variations are meant just to treat type 2 diabetes like Ozempic. Other drugs like WeGovy are meant to treat obesity as well.\nWhat I take issue with is that a lot of commenters have stated that they see Ozempic as a ‚Äúlose weight quick drug‚Äù and a cheat. I think this is simply the wrong way to look at the issue. Obesity is a medical issue that can be treated in many ways. For some people seeing a nutritionist and going to the gym is all that is needed but for many more this simply doesn‚Äôt work. I would argue that actually most Americans know generally what a good diet looks like. They may not have all the details but most people can tell you that more vegetables and less meat carbs and sugar will create a calorie deficit and help you lose weight. However food simply tastes really good any many people rely on it as a sort of emotional crutch. Many also lack the time energy and desire to cook healthy food for themselves. There are many who also simply have a naturally large appetite and need to eat more in order to feel full.\nWhat those people need is not a reminder to try ‚Äúdiet and exercise‚Äù they need medical help. Semaglutide injections seem to have low risk of serious side effects and can help those people eat less and not feel hungry. All this moralizing about who ‚Äúdeserves‚Äù help and who should just suck it up and go to the gym is proving to be detrimental to overall health.\nAlso I‚Äôm aware that there is currently a shortage of Semaglutide injections right now but lets set that aside and assume that can be addressed with a more robust supply chain.",

Even after losing some weight cutting out junk and exercising my A1C went from 10.2 to just 10. I am so frustrated and discouraged especially because I was given three months by my doctor to get it under control this no diabetes meds and I worked hard and with little result. So because he knows I‚Äôm not good with Metformin he‚Äôs now prescribed Januvia. I‚Äôve researched it and now terrified to take it but I know I have to.

            "Hi all! This goes for Saxenda and any other weight loss meds. I‚Äôm getting discouraged from how little weight I‚Äôve lost on Victoza compared to others I‚Äôve read about. Normally I‚Äôd give a medication more time to work (I‚Äôve been on it almost 6 weeks) but most of what I‚Äôve read is people losing the most weight within the first month or even the first 2 weeks. If you‚Äôve tried Victoza please share how it worked/didn‚Äôt work for you. I‚Äôd love to know how long you took it your dose timeline and when and how much weight you lost. Also open to tips if any come to mind.\nI‚Äôm a 25 year old non-diabetic female at 5‚Äô4 and 280lbs. I lost about 200lbs naturally with diet and exercise and got down to 190lbs for the first time since I was a child. I hit a plateau and then the pandemic depression and emotional distress in moving back home brought me back up to 280lbs within one year. I decided to try a weight loss med to just get a little motivation back. Only Victoza was covered by insurance and able to be found.\nI‚Äôve been on it for about 6 weeks now. I took 0.6 dose for 4 weeks and only lost 2lbs. I‚Äôve now been on 1.2 dose for almost 2 weeks and while I haven‚Äôt weighed myself I notice very little difference. Meanwhile I‚Äôm eating healthily and much less in portion and have stopped emotionally eating entirely. I still work out but not as much ‚Äî due to the side effects hitting me hard. Constant fluttery stomach and migraine heavy nausea lightheadedness and increasingly excessive fatigue. It‚Äôs been tolerable so far especially because it‚Äôs taken my appetite away and I‚Äôve eaten so much less.\nSo to have lost nearly no weight is very disheartening. My insurance denied my request for Wegovy coverage which I‚Äôm debating on appealing. I really hoped Victoza would be effective. Has anyone had a similar experience with not losing much weight? Did it ever start working better? What‚Äôs your Victoza story? Thanks!",

Now it seems like to food stays too long in my stomach and rots? I know I‚Äôm going to be sick when I start burping that rotten egg smell.\nThe endo doc told me to lower my dosage from 1.8ml to a 0.6ml until my body can tolerate it again. It‚Äôs been 2 mths since I had the gall bladder surgery and I though I would have ‚Äú leveled out‚Äù by now. My surgeon is no help since I‚Äôve physically healed and not in any more pain.
